    Bacteria are single cells that can survive on 
    their own, inside or outside the body. Viruses cause infections by e
    ntering and multiplying inside the host's healthy cells. It can be 
    difficult to know what causes an infection, because viral and bacterial 
    infections can cause similar symptoms
    But what is the difference between these two types of germs? Bacteria
     are single cells that can multiply and cause infection. Viruses are
     much smaller than bacteria and need a host cell to reproduce. Viruses 
     can only infect living cells, while bacteria can also infect non-living
      things like soil or water.
People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported â€“ ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms.

This list does not include all possible symptoms. Symptoms may change with new COVID-19 variants and can vary depending on vaccination status. CDC will continue to update this list as we learn more about COVID-19. Older adults and people who have underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19.
